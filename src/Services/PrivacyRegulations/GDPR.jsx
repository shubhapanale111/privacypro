        </h3>
      <p className='subtitle2'>The 1995 Data Protection Directive has been succeeded by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), representing the new European Union data privacy framework. Under this regulation, a pivotal emphasis is placed on affording individuals greater control over their data, necessitating explicit consent from customers before the collection, storage, or utilization of their information by companies.
In order to ensure compliance with the GDPR, organizations are mandated to undertake various measures. These encompass the establishment of both organizational and technical safeguards to secure personal data, a comprehensive assessment of existing data protection policies, and the appointment of a designated data protection officer. Adherence to these requirements not only aligns entities with regulatory obligations but also underscores their commitment to upholding robust data protection standards. </p></div>
